Understanding Decision Analysis


**Lesson Objectives**
Be able to identify a decision
Understand the difference between decisions and outcomes
Be able to model a simple decision with discrete uncertainties

**Decision:**

“A decision is a choice between two or more
alternatives that involve an irrevocable allocation
of resources”

value of clairvoyance could be calculated 

but the problem is that there is no clairvoyance in real life

so the decision with the detector is important to decide between buying the detector or not.

Decision analysis has evolved from theoretical concepts to practical applications, creating a structured approach to weigh various factors influencing a decision. This field uniquely incorporates the treatment of uncertainty with subjective probability and manages risk attitudes using utility theory. A key aspect is the mapping of problem relationships, which can be visualized in a graphical problem space. Together with other preference metrics, these elements form the decision analysis cycle—a conceptual model for decision-making. This cycle has three phases: deterministic, probabilistic, and informational, each clarifying the significance of variables in respective environments. An important feature of this discipline is its capability to economically value the reduction or removal of uncertainty through experimentation. Recent implementations in business and government suggest that decision analysis enhances logical depth, offering new possibilities for rational decision-making to those who seek it.

Value of Clairvoyance

Value of Clairvoyance is the value of knowing particular information prior to making a decision.
The Value of Clairvoyance is the answer to the question, “How much would it be worth to know that information now, before we make our decision and act, instead of later?”In this case, the information you would like to know could reveal one of two or more possibilities.If the revealed information could potentially change your actions, then knowing it before your decision would have value.You can calculate that value by valuing your original situation versus the situation in which the information will be revealed to you ahead of time.(Note that calculating the Value of Clairvoyance is a shortcut to what you really want to know — should you gather information or not.Value of Clairvoyance can’t guarantee that you'll make the right choice to gather information or not.To make the right decisions, you can explicitly model the decision to gather information as part of a more formal decision model.Value of Clairvoyance is the definition of VOI used in the field of Decision Analysis.


Further information about the coin game in the class

To see how to calculate the value of these three types of information, we’ll use an example of flipping a bent coin, which is a typical example used to introduce new probability-related ideas.Suppose you and I discover a coin lying on the ground that is obviously bent.I offer you a dollar if you are able to flip the coin and guess whether it lands as heads or tails.You believe that the coin will land on heads with a 60% probability.Having experience calculating expected value, you figure that the expected value of this opportunity is 60 cents.Now suppose that upon closer inspection, you notice that the coin is sticky on the tails side.Suppose this new information changes your probability of heads from 60% all the way down to 30%.(Note that to keep this example simple, I used a small amount of money and am not worrying about how such a small amount of unexpected money may affect your life.Counter to traditional Decision Analysis, I am also not a fan of muddying valuation by including some sort of utility function as a rough estimate of a more complete and accurate model, even with personal decisions.)

Strategic VOI Question
How much value did you gain by learning about the stickiness of the coin before you chose heads or tails?
With the new information about the stickiness, you will now choose tails and have an expected value of 70 cents.You otherwise would have chosen heads and only had an expected value of 30 cents.Knowing about the stickiness is therefore worth 40 cents.

Perceived VOI Question
How much did the stickiness change the value of the opportunity?
You began with a value of 60 cents and ended with a value of 70 cents, so the difference is 10 cents.

Value of Clairvoyance Question
How much would it be worth to know whether the coin will land heads or tails before you flip?
If you know whether the coin will land as heads or tails in advance, then you are guaranteed to get a dollar.The difference between that dollar and the expected value of 70 cents you have if you have to guess is 30 cents.
