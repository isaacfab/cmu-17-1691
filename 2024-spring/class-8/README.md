## Lecture Insights

### MLOps Stack
- Data sourcing is a key part of ML engineering. Once you start collecting your own data, how you collect it can have long term consequences.
- Ethical considerations show up in integration testing and deployment to production, a stage which in turn feeds the ML engineering lifecycle.
- Most subcomponents associated with ethics and governance correspond to Data Versioning, Data Labeling, Model Versioning, MVP Demos, CI/CD, testing and Model Monitoring:

### Ethics
- AI/ML ethics matter because it can help identify biases in AI tooling.

- Four primary categories for ethics considerations:

- Data Security and Privacy Risk: Amazon fined $877M over 2019-2022
- Adversarial/Counter AI: be cautious about abuse cases, such as celebrity deep fakes
- Unpredictable Behavior: Microsoft's Tay was turned into a racist chatbot
- Harmful/Biased Autonomy: facial recognition software with bias towards certain ethnicities


### Governance
- In the right setting, governance can encourage best practices in engineering
- It's not just for fun, in some places it's required by law (such as GDPR)
- Governance can vary significantly by industry, such as government applications
- Data flywheel model lifecycle requires governance

- Governance starts with a strategy which outlines specific values
- DVC is an example of a model governance tool 
- DataHub is an example of a data governance tool 

### Wrap Up
- Consider ethical implcations of your product at all stages of development
- Governance is critical to both ethcial and provenance concerns for prouct improvement
